# Menthub 👥📘

**Menthub** is a full-stack web platform designed to bridge the gap between college students seeking guidance (*mentees*) and those offering support (*mentors*) — all within the same academic environment.

It enables seamless mentor-mentee connections, encourages peer-driven learning, and promotes a culture of collaboration and growth.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Navigating college life — from academics and internships to placements and time management — can be challenging. **Menthub** was created to:

- Help students get guidance from peers in relevant areas.
- Enable peer-to-peer mentorship based on experience and skills.
- Enable students to **volunteer as mentors** based on their strengths.
- Provide a smart **profile-based matching system** using machine learning.
- Build a positive environment of support and shared growth.

Whether you're a first-year looking for advice or a final-year student ready to guide others — **Menthub** is for you.
